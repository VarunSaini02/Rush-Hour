        I pulled your branch from Github, but it didn't seem to have the View Controller
        that you were working on. I guess it didn't commit properly? So, I just made
        blank View Controller called Rush Hour Menu Scene, and you can put everything
        you were working on in there. It is connected to the Navigation Controller but
        is not linked to the Rush Hour Game Board Scene View Controller, which is the
        renamed version of our old View Controller.
